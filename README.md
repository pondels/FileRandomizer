# Osu Skin Randomizer
An executable that randomizes files in a directory

# How it works
- It takes a directory, preferrably that of your osu skin folder, and copies the directory into your working directory. It then takes 2 random files and pushes them into the copied directory. Vuala, randomized skin. Enjoy

# NOTE
Remember to check any other file types that don't transfer based on the "include" variable. It's possible you might be missing some metadata, and ruining the experience! :(
