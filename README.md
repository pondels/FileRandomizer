# File Randomizer

An executable that randomizes files in a directory

# For a brief tech demo (slightly outdated) go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XHYRtNWBnY&t=1s)

#### If you want a more updated version of this demo, all the new functions and how to use them to their max extent are in [example.py](example.py).

# How it works

- It takes a directory, preferrably that of your osu skin folder, and copies the directory into your working directory. It then takes 2 random files and pushes them into the copied directory. Vuala, randomized skin. Enjoy

# NOTE

Remember to check any other file types that don't transfer based on the "include" variable. It's possible you might be missing some metadata, and ruining the experience! :(

Be sure to check out [example.py](example.py), it showcases a good example of utilizing this class.

## EXAMPLES

For osu! it can look something like this...

<img src="imageExamples\osuExampleTwo.png" width="350">

One thing to note is that this isn't specific to OSU!. The only reason for that was because it was built in the intent for OSU! files, yet still technically works for other games. You can utilize this for other games such as Geometry Dash and Minecraft, but you get... interesting results, however, isn't that the point?
